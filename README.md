# ‚≠ê HorizonUX

**What‚Äôs poppin‚Äô, fam? Welcome to the wild world of HorizonUX!**

- **Just a Lil‚Äô Reminder**: That cute Genshin Impact character "Paimon"? Not mine, just some fire fan art I found on Google Images. Mad respect to the artist! üé®‚ú®

- **What‚Äôs the 411?**: I‚Äôm out here trying to whip up some ultra-custom Samsung One UI vibes! This is an open-source adventure, still in the oven, so keep your eyes peeled for some spicy updates! üî•üöÄ

- **Keep It Real**: If you snag any of my goodies, just make sure to keep it open source and hit me up with some credit! Sharing is caring, y‚Äôall! ü§óüíØ

Thanks for dropping by, You‚Äôre a true legend! üíñ‚ú®
